Hello! My name is Ash Furrow. I'm a compassionate software developer from New Brunswick, Canada. I sing and play guitar. I run. I even like to cook.

The first ten years of my career as a software developer are publicly documented ([part one](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-years-of-ios/), [part two](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-more-years-of-building-software/)). The tl;dr is:

- I built iPhone apps in university, starting in 2009.
- I got a scholarship to WWDC in 2010.
- I moved around the world a bit, from Toronto to Amsterdam to New York. [I spoke at a lot of conferences](https://ashfurrow.com/speaking/).
- I led [Artsy's](https://www.artsy.net) Mobile Experience team building the [totally open source iOS app](https://github.com/artsy/eigen).
- I moved home to New Brunswick, Canada during the pandemic.
- I joined [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/) and led the [Shop Minis SDK](https://shop.app/minis).
- I joined [Float](https://floatcard.com) in 2023 and lead their Mobile team.

The best is yet to come!
