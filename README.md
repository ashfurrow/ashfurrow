Hello! My name is Ash Furrow. I'm a compassionate software developer from rural Canada, but now I live in New York. I sing and play guitar. I run. I even like to cook.

The first ten years of my career as a software developer are publicly documented ([part one](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-years-of-ios/), [part two](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-more-years-of-building-software/)). The tl;dr is that I built a few iPhone apps while in university, then got a scholarship to WWDC in 2010, then I moved around the world a bit, and now I lead [Artsy's](https://www.artsy.net) Mobile Experience team building our [totally open source iOS app](https://github.com/artsy/eigen).

Oh, and I also administer [mastodon.technology](https://mastodon.technology/), an instance of the open source social network. Come say hi :wave:
